1.2 Problem Statement 

With the increased use of solar energy as a distribution generation system, there is a lack of sufficient knowledge and data that will provide the locals with enough description on the concept of solar trackers. This project, therefore, seeks to design a solar tracking system that will help in maximizing the power from solar and providing sufficient data that will help the locals switch from the use of fixed solar panels.
1.3 Justification 


Solar tracking system helps to increase the overall efficiency of solar energy production by tracking the movement of the sun and hence maximizing the collection of solar irradiances. Since solar is a renewable source of energy it will reduce the dependence on non-renewable sources helping the country to meet the increased electricity demand.
It also helps to reduce the stress on the distribution and transmission systems as it will act as a distributed generation system reducing the load connected which will help relieve congestion.
1.4 Aims and Objectives

1.4.1 Main objective


1.	To design a solar tracking system that will help in maximizing harvesting more solar energy.
1.4.2 Specific objectives
1.	To develop an algorithm that will enable the solar tracker movement based on the sun's position during the day.
2.	To evaluate the performance of the designed solar tracking system through simulation and experimental tests.
3.	To obtain data that can be used for future references and making techno-economic decisions.
